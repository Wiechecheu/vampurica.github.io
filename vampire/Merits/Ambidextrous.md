# Ambidextrous (2)

### General Merit

An Ambidextrous Kindred may, once per turn (including on Celerity rounds, but still only once per turn) augment a weapon attack (either melee or ranged) with both the qualities of her main-hand armament and her off-hand armament. For example, a Kindred attacking with a brutal dagger in her main-hand and a deadly dagger in her off-hand may make a melee attack with both the brutal and deadly qualities.

A Kindred cannot use Ambidextrous to apply the same quality twice, so attacking with a brutal dagger in each hand can only confer the brutal bonus once. Also, common sense still applies to whether the additional qualities can be added. If the Kindred is making a ranged attack with a pistol, she cannot benefit from the qualities of her off-hand dagger. Likewise, if she is dual-weilding daggers and her off-hand dagger is grappled, holstered or destroyed, she cannot apply the qualities of her off-hand dagger to her main-hand attacks.
