# Additional Common Discipline (4)

### General Merit

On some occassions, a Kindred's blood carries traces of a fourth discipline, perhaps something her sire learned, perhaps an adaptation to overcome a specific challenge or perhaps a freak mutation. A Kindred with an Additional Common Discipline may choose one of the following as an additional in-clan discipline: Animalism, Auspex, Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude, Objuscate, Potence or Presence. She does not start with free dots in this discipline, but she may assign xp to this discipline during character creation. She pays in-clan costs to level this discipline, other merits interact with this discipline as if they are natively in-clan and she may teach this discipline as normal.

This merit may not be combined with other merits that give additional disciplines. This does not prevent a Caitiff from taking this merit alongside Inceptor or Vestiges of Greatness.
