# Adaptive (1)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Caitiff](../Clans/Caitiff))

Flexibility is a Caitiff's greatest asset, and being Adaptive to her disciplines is simply the logical conclusion of that flexibility. A Caitiff with Adaptive selects a single in-clan discipline that she possesses and receives the benefit of alle attribute focuses for that discipline, even if she does not possess them.

For example, if a strength-focus Caitiff selects Fortitude as her Adaptive discipline, she gains the additional health levels that the stamina focus normally provides. If a wits-focus Caitiff selects Auspex as her Adaptive discipline, she gains access to the perception focus benefits for Heightened Seneses, Aura Perception and Sprits Touch, which would normally be unavailable to her. Adaptive cannot be used to get the benefits of a focus twice, for example, a strength-focus Caitiff cannot double the brawl/melee bonus granted by Potence by selecting that as her Adaptive discipline.
